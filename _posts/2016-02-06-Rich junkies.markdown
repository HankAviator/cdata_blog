The drug abuse study attracts me much for some reason. From experience of myself, it seems the reason why a person started using drugs isn't simple. Was it for fun? Or was the life too hard without some kind of matter for relief? And different from tobacco use, the access to drug can be significantly hard. There are many factors involved, like income, use period of the target drug etc.

To narrow down the range, I decide to find out the correlation between **income** (a sign of life status, social position etc.) and **longest use duration of amphetamine** (this drug was chosen for some reason too..). So, there can be three results:
1. A positive correlation between income and use duration.
2. Negative correlation
3. No *significant* correlation, by statistical deduction.
But of course, we'd better check if people ever use it - most people don't take drugs regularly.

Google scholar suggests low-income people are vulnerable to drug use. My hypothesis is therefore **The drug use duration is negatively correlated with income.**
