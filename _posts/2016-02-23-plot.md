The final week. Not much to explain, simply print the plots.
Check it [here](/cdata_blog/pages/week4_output/) .
I used `proc freq` for frequency distribution plot, since the code doesn't make sense if `proc univariate` is used.

It seems people with at least moderate income and distribution is normal, but the plot shows no statistical significance.
